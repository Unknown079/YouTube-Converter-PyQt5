# YouTube-Converter-PyQt5

Please install FFMPEG and FFPROBE because MP3 will work better and will not close giving an error after you convert something with MP3 FORMAT.
Also if you have python installed then go to the main directory where you installed python, then go to Scripts and put those files there, into the scripts directory/folder.

In my case its ----->  D:\Python\Scripts\youtube-dl.exe <-----  because I have python installed there..

If you don't have python installed the go to the link below and download the app `.exe`..
