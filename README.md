# YouTube-Converter-PyQt5

Please install FFMPEG and FFPROBE because MP3 will work better and will not close giving an error after u install something in mp3 format.
Also if u have python installed then go to the main directory where u installed python, then go to scripts and put those files there, into the scripts directory/folder.

In my case its ----->  D:\Python\Scripts\youtube-dl.exe <-----  because I have python installed there.. 

If u don't have python installed then try to put FFMPEG and FFPROBE into the folder where u have the MAIN FILES to the app, if it doesn't work then I'll try to find another way
in the later update..
But in both cases, the program makes its job..

I hope u enjoy it :)
